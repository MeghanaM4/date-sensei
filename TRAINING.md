# Training

We used a camera above, a camera attached to the arm, and a front camera. We trained the model on the following tasks:
- the user puts their elbows on the table or looks at their phone --> the arm throws object
- the user does the 6-7 gesture --> the arm throws object
- the user sits polietly --> the arm does nothing
