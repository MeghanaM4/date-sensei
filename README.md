## What It Does
This is an SO-101 ARM robot arm to coach you through your dates, made with a Lerobot SO-101 ARM and AMD AI magic. When the camera sees the person put their elbows on the table, look on their phone, or do the 6-7 hand gesture, the robot arm will throw papers red flag at the person.

## Wiring Diagram

## Tech Stack
We used the [HuggingFace Lerobot SO-101 ARM](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/en/so101) with a wrist cam, ring lights, a webcam, and a standing camera. Our PC was a Dell Pro Max 16 with an AMD Ryzen™ AI 9 HX PRO 370 w/ Radeon™ 890M × 24 processor (thank you AMD), and to train we used AMD's ROCm GPU. the ring light, all 3 cameras, and both the leader and follower arm were connected to the PC via USB (we used 2 USB hubs).
